Description
-----------
This package is intended to manipulate irregular time series such as subtime series, series based on time intervals, etc.

This package uses only POSIX* format.

Main things defined in this package are the classes POSIXcti, POSIXctp, TimeIntervalDataFrame, TimeInstantDataFrame, SubtimeDataFrame, methods to switch from one class to another and the changeSupport method for TimeIntervalDataFrame.

News
-----------
* V1.1-2 :
RegularTimeInstantDataFrame and RegularTimeIntervalDataFrame :
the 'to' argument is no more necessary if 'from', 'by' and 'data' are given.

Bug fix in plot method on the returned parameters

* 09/03/2012 V1.1-1 :

For 'subtime' functions (and associated), a 'first.day' argument is added. It indicated the first day of week in case of 'wday' subtime.

A 'lapply' function is added for TimeIntervalDataFrame, TimeInstantDataFrame and SubtimeDataFrame.

Plot functions for TimeIntervalDataFrame, TimeInstantDataFrame and SubtimeDataFrame return (invisibly) params used for the plot.

--------------
* 07/02/2012 :

The package is now on CRAN. Could take a while to be on all mirrors but already available on some (on French servers it's ok).

To install or update only use :
- install.packages ('timetools')
- update.packages ('timetools')
- or keep downloading it from sourceforge.
